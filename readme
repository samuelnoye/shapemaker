Shape Maker
How many output statements do you need to draw two-dimensional shapes? Using loops, the answer to this question is 2. In this project, you will create a square and a triangle of any size using nested loops with one print() statement and one println() statement.

We’ll create a basic square pattern using loop concepts we covered in the previous lesson. We’ll even take it a step further by getting our program to output a checkerboard pattern.

Then, we’ll explore how nesting a while loop inside of a for loop can be used to create a triangle pattern in the output terminal. This will give us a different perspective of nested loops and how to control variables when using while loops.

Good luck with the project and have fun!
